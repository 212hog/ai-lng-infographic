üí° Powering the AI Revolution: The Strategic Role of LNG (Interactive Infographic)
This project presents an interactive web infographic that highlights the strategic imperative of Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) in meeting the unprecedented energy demands of AI infrastructure from 2025 to 2035. It features dynamic charts, AI-powered insights for related companies, and an interactive glossary.

‚ú® Features
Dynamic Data Visualizations: Interactive charts illustrating U.S. data center power demand and global LNG supply growth.

AI-Powered Insights: Get concise summaries and potential risks for key companies in the LNG sector, generated by the Gemini AI model.

Interactive Glossary: Click on underlined terms to get quick, AI-generated explanations.

Responsive Design: Optimized for viewing on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

üèóÔ∏è Architecture
The project consists of two main components:

Frontend (GitHub Pages): A static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript website hosted on GitHub Pages. It handles the user interface, data visualization, and makes requests to the backend for AI interactions.

Backend (Google Cloud Run): A Node.js service deployed on Google Cloud Run. This service acts as a secure proxy to the Google Gemini API, protecting your API key and handling AI text generation requests from the frontend.

üöÄ Setup Guide
Follow these steps to set up and deploy your interactive infographic.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

Git: Installed on your local machine.

Node.js & npm: Installed on your local machine.

Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI): Installed and configured.

Install gcloud CLI

Google Cloud Project: An active Google Cloud project (e.g., my-ai-infographic-backend-2025).

Gemini API Key: Obtain an API key from Google AI Studio or Google Cloud Console.

Part 1: Frontend Deployment (GitHub Pages)
This part sets up your website.

Clone the Repository:
If you haven't already, clone this GitHub repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-lng-infographic.git
cd ai-lng-infographic

(Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username and ai-lng-infographic with your repository name if different).

Place index.html in Root:
Ensure your index.html file (which contains all the frontend code: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) is located directly in the root of your ai-lng-infographic directory. Do not include the index.html code directly in this README file.

Commit and Push to GitHub:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of interactive infographic frontend"
git push origin main # Or 'git push origin master' if that's your default branch

Enable GitHub Pages:

Go to your GitHub repository on the web.

Click on "Settings" -> "Pages" in the left sidebar.

Under "Build and deployment," ensure "Source" is set to "Deploy from a branch" and the branch is set to main (or master) with / (root) folder.

Click "Save".

Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to deploy. You can check the "Actions" tab in your repository for deployment status.

Part 2: Backend Deployment (Google Cloud Run)
This part sets up the secure proxy to the Gemini AI.

Create Backend Directory:
Outside your frontend repository, create a new directory for your backend code:

mkdir gemini-proxy-service
cd gemini-proxy-service

Create package.json:
Create a file named package.json inside gemini-proxy-service and add the following content:

{
  "name": "gemini-proxy-service",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Proxy service for Gemini API calls",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@google/generative-ai": "^0.11.0",
    "express": "^4.19.2",
    "cors": "^2.8.5"
  }
}

Create index.js (Cloud Run Service Code):
Create a file named index.js inside gemini-proxy-service and add the content for your Cloud Run service.

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: In this index.js file, ensure you replace YOUR_EXACT_GITHUB_PAGES_BASE_URL with the precise base URL of your GitHub Pages site. This is crucial for CORS.

Example: If your GitHub Pages URL is https://your-username.github.io/ai-lng-infographic/, your base URL is https://your-username.github.io.

If you're using a custom domain (e.g., https://www.your-custom-domain.com), use that exact URL.

Authenticate gcloud and Set Project:
(If you haven't done this recently)

gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project my-ai-infographic-backend-2025 # Use your actual project ID

Deploy the Cloud Run Service:

Make sure you are in the gemini-proxy-service directory in your terminal.

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Replace "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY" with your actual Gemini API key.

This command will build and deploy your service. It might take a few minutes.

gcloud run deploy geminiproxy \
  --source . \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --set-env-vars GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY" \
  --project my-ai-infographic-backend-2025

After deployment, gcloud will output the Service URL. This URL is hardcoded in your index.html frontend.

üíª Live Demo
Experience the interactive infographic live on GitHub Pages:

https://your-username.github.io/ai-lng-infographic/
(Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username and ai-lng-infographic with your repository name).

üí° Usage
Once both the frontend (GitHub Pages) and backend (Cloud Run) are deployed:

Open your GitHub Pages URL in a web browser.

U.S. Data Center Power Demand Forecast (GW): Observe the line chart showing projected power demand.

Projected LNG Capacity Growth by 2030 (Mtpa): View the doughnut chart illustrating the share of LNG capacity between the US and Qatar.

Interactive Glossary: Click on any underlined term (e.g., "dispatchable baseload power", "Behind-the-meter", "CCUS", "Mtpa") to open a modal with an AI-generated explanation.

Ask AI About LNG & AI: Type a question into the input field and click "Ask AI ‚ú®" to get a concise answer from the Gemini AI model.

Get AI Insights: Click the "Get AI Insights ‚ú®" button on any stock card to receive an AI-generated investment summary for that company in the context of AI and LNG.

üêõ Troubleshooting
"Error communicating with AI service. Please try again." on website:

Browser Cache: Perform a hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R or Cmd + Shift + R) on your GitHub Pages site.

CORS: Ensure the allowedOrigin variable in your gemini-proxy-service/index.js precisely matches your GitHub Pages base URL (e.g., https://your-username.github.io). If you changed it, redeploy the Cloud Run service.

Cloud Run Logs: Check the logs for your geminiproxy service in the Google Cloud Console (Cloud Run -> geminiproxy -> Logs tab) for any errors.

gcloud crashed (ValueError): ZIP does not support timestamps before 1980 during deployment:

Navigate to your gemini-proxy-service directory in the terminal and run find . -exec touch {} + (Mac/Linux) or Get-ChildItem -Recurse | ForEach-Object { $_.LastWriteTime = Get-Date } (PowerShell) to update file timestamps, then retry deployment.

AI responses are slow or fail with 429 Too Many Requests:

This indicates you're hitting API rate limits. The backend has exponential backoff, but persistent issues might require a higher quota for the Gemini API in your Google Cloud project.
